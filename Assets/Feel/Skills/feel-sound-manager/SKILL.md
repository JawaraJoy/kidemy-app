# Play and Control Sound with MMSoundManager

`MMSoundManager` (namespace `MoreMountains.Tools`) is Feel's audio manager. It plays sounds on pooled `AudioSource`s, routes them through an AudioMixer with four built-in tracks (Master, Music, Sfx, UI, plus custom tracks), and can be driven three ways: from MMF Player feedbacks (`Audio > MMSoundManager *`), through one-line events, or by direct calls on `MMSoundManager.Instance`. This skill lets an agent play one-shot, looping and 3D sounds, and control them by ID, by track or all at once, from feedbacks or code. Installing and configuring the managers themselves is covered by `feel-sound-and-playlist-setup`.

## When to use this skill

- "play a jump sound" / "random pitch on footsteps" / "pick a random hit sound"
- "loop the background music" / "play music on the music track"
- "pause all sounds when the pause menu opens" / "mute the music track from code"
- "fade the music out over 2 seconds" / "fade this sound in"
- "play the explosion sound at the explosion position, in 3D"
- "while the boss line plays, mute the other tracks" (solo)
- "stop that looping engine sound when the car is destroyed"
- "my MMSM sound feedback plays nothing"

Not for:
- Adding/configuring the MMSoundManager, mixer routing, custom tracks, volume slider UI, saving audio settings, playlists → `feel-sound-and-playlist-setup`
- Vibration / haptics → `feel-haptics`
- Sequencing non-audio feedbacks → `feel-add-feedbacks`
- Pitch/volume springs on an `AudioSource` → `feel-springs` (`MMSpringAudioSourcePitch`, `MMSpringAudioSourceVolume`)

## Prerequisites

- Feel 6.1, Unity 6000.5+, any render pipeline.
- **Install check:** `System.Type.GetType("MoreMountains.Tools.MMSoundManager, MoreMountains.Tools")` is not null, and the folder `Assets/Feel/MMTools/Core/MMAudio/MMSoundManager` exists. If not, tell the user Feel is not installed (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/feel-183370) and stop.
- Scripts need `using MoreMountains.Tools;` (and `using MoreMountains.Feedbacks;` for feedback classes).
- The default settings asset is `Assets/Feel/MMTools/Core/MMAudio/MMSoundManager/Settings/MMSoundManagerSettings.asset`, which uses the mixer `MMSoundManagerAudioMixer.mixer` in the same folder.

## Quick start

A jump sound with slight random pitch, through the manager:

1. Create an empty GameObject at the scene root named `MMSoundManager` and add `Add Component > More Mountains > Tools > Audio > MM Sound Manager`. Check that its **Settings** slot (`settingsSo`) references `MMSoundManagerSettings`; if it is empty, assign the default asset above. If the project has no sound manager yet, or needs more than this minimal setup (persistence across scenes, custom mixer), follow `feel-sound-and-playlist-setup` first.
2. On the jump's MMF Player (see `feel-add-feedbacks`), **Add new feedback > Audio > MMSoundManager Sound** (`MMF_MMSoundManagerSound`). Set **Sfx** to the clip, `MinPitch = 0.9`, `MaxPitch = 1.1`. The track defaults to `Sfx`. In edit mode, the feedback's test buttons let you audition the clip.
3. Editor-script equivalent:

```csharp
using MoreMountains.Feedbacks;
using MoreMountains.Tools;
using UnityEditor;
using UnityEditor.SceneManagement;
using UnityEngine;

public static class FeelSoundQuickStart
{
    public static void AddJumpSound(MMF_Player player, AudioClip clip)
    {
        if (Object.FindAnyObjectByType<MMSoundManager>() == null)
        {
            GameObject sm = new GameObject("MMSoundManager");
            Undo.RegisterCreatedObjectUndo(sm, "Create MMSoundManager");
            sm.AddComponent<MMSoundManager>();
        }
        Undo.RecordObject(player, "Add MMSM Sound");
        MMF_MMSoundManagerSound sound = (MMF_MMSoundManagerSound)player.AddFeedback(typeof(MMF_MMSoundManagerSound));
        sound.Sfx = clip;
        sound.MinPitch = 0.9f;
        sound.MaxPitch = 1.1f;
        EditorUtility.SetDirty(player);
        EditorSceneManager.MarkSceneDirty(player.gameObject.scene);
    }
}
```

(The feedback's **Automatic Shaker Setup** button does the same `MMSoundManager` creation.)

4. Expected result: the scene contains exactly one `MMSoundManager`; the player has an `MMF_MMSoundManagerSound` with `Sfx` assigned; in Play mode, playing the player plays the clip on the Sfx track at a slightly different pitch each time, and the manager inspector's Sfx track shows a playing sound.

## Workflows

### Workflow: Play sounds from code

**Goal:** play a sound without an MMF Player.

**Steps:**
1. Simple call (2D, Sfx track, at a position):

```csharp
using MoreMountains.Tools;
using UnityEngine;

public class Explosion : MonoBehaviour
{
    public AudioClip ExplosionSfx;

    public void Explode()
    {
        MMSoundManagerSoundPlayEvent.Trigger(ExplosionSfx, MMSoundManager.MMSoundManagerTracks.Sfx, transform.position);
    }
}
```

2. With options (start from the defaults, override what you need):

```csharp
MMSoundManagerPlayOptions options = MMSoundManagerPlayOptions.Default; // Sfx track, volume 1, pitch 1, 2D
options.MmSoundManagerTrack = MMSoundManager.MMSoundManagerTracks.Music;
options.Loop = true;
options.Volume = 0.5f;
options.ID = 50;                // lets you control this sound later
options.Persistent = true;      // survives scene loads
AudioSource source = MMSoundManagerSoundPlayEvent.Trigger(MusicClip, options);
```

3. Prefer events over `MMSoundManager.Instance` calls: events don't throw when no manager is listening. `MMSoundManager.Instance` auto-creates a manager if none exists.

**Expected result:** the clip plays; with `Loop = true` it repeats until stopped.

### Workflow: Play a 3D sound

**Goal:** positional audio that attenuates with distance.

**Steps:**
1. In the MMSoundManager Sound feedback (or in `MMSoundManagerPlayOptions`), set **Spatial Blend** to 1. Optionally set `MinDistance` / `MaxDistance` (1 and 500 by default) and `RolloffMode` (Logarithmic by default).
2. The sound plays at the position passed to `PlayFeedbacks(position, intensity)` (or at the player's position), or follows a transform via **Attach To Transform**.
3. Make sure an `AudioListener` exists (usually on the main camera).

**Expected result:** volume and panning change with the listener's distance and direction.

### Workflow: Control a sound by ID

**Goal:** stop, pause, fade or free a specific playing sound.

**Steps:**
1. Give the sound a non-zero, unique **ID** (feedback field `ID`, or `options.ID`).
2. Feedbacks: `Audio > MMSoundManager Sound Control` (pause / resume / stop / free) and `Audio > MMSoundManager Sound Fade`, with the same ID.
3. Code:

```csharp
MMSoundManagerSoundControlEvent.Trigger(MMSoundManagerSoundControlEventTypes.Stop, 50);
MMSoundManagerSoundFadeEvent.Trigger(MMSoundManagerSoundFadeEvent.Modes.PlayFade, 50, 2f, 0f,
    new MMTweenType(MMTween.MMTweenCurve.EaseInCubic)); // fade sound 50 to 0 over 2s
MMSoundManagerSoundControlEvent.Trigger(MMSoundManagerSoundControlEventTypes.Free, 50); // return its AudioSource to the pool
```

**Expected result:** only sounds with that ID react.

### Workflow: Track volume, mute and pause

**Goal:** mute, set volume, pause or stop whole tracks at runtime (pause menus, cutscenes, game over).

**Steps:**
1. No-code mute: on a UI Button's **On Click ()**, drag the `MMSoundManager` object and pick `MMSoundManager > MuteMaster` (or `UnmuteMaster`, `MuteMusic`, `MuteSfx`, `MuteUI`, ...).
2. Volume from code or UnityEvents: `SetVolumeMusic(float)`, `SetVolumeSfx(float)`, `SetVolumeUI(float)`, `SetVolumeMaster(float)`. For options-menu sliders that stay in sync with the tracks, use `MMSoundManagerTrackVolumeSlider` as described in `feel-sound-and-playlist-setup`.
3. Feedbacks: `Audio > MMSoundManager Track Control` (mute, unmute, set volume, play, pause, stop, free a track), `Audio > MMSoundManager Track Fade`, `Audio > MMSoundManager All Sounds Control`.
4. Code:

```csharp
MMSoundManagerTrackEvent.Trigger(MMSoundManagerTrackEventTypes.PauseTrack, MMSoundManager.MMSoundManagerTracks.Music);
MMSoundManagerTrackEvent.Trigger(MMSoundManagerTrackEventTypes.SetVolumeTrack, MMSoundManager.MMSoundManagerTracks.Sfx, 0.5f);
MMSoundManagerTrackFadeEvent.Trigger(MMSoundManagerTrackFadeEvent.Modes.PlayFade, MMSoundManager.MMSoundManagerTracks.Music,
    2f, 0f, new MMTweenType(MMTween.MMTweenCurve.EaseInCubic));
MMSoundManagerAllSoundsControlEvent.Trigger(MMSoundManagerAllSoundsControlEventTypes.Stop);
```

5. Check activity: `MMSoundManager.Instance.HasSoundsPlaying(MMSoundManager.MMSoundManagerTracks.Sfx)`.

**Expected result:** the chosen track mutes, changes volume or pauses; other tracks are unaffected.

### Workflow: Use the simple Sound feedback instead

**Goal:** play a clip without a sound manager (prototype, isolated object).

**Steps:** add `Audio > Sound` (`MMF_Sound`). `PlayMethod` defaults to `Event`, which needs an `MMSoundManager` to catch it; set it to `Cached` (AudioSource created at init), `OnDemand` (created on play) or `Pool` to play without a manager. Prefer `MMSoundManager Sound` for anything beyond prototypes: it has tracks, IDs, fades and solo modes.

**Expected result:** the clip plays when the player plays.

## Verification

- Exactly one `MMSoundManager` in the scene: `Object.FindObjectsByType<MoreMountains.Tools.MMSoundManager>().Length == 1`, and its `settingsSo != null`.
- The feedback exists with a clip: `player.GetFeedbackOfType<MMF_MMSoundManagerSound>().Sfx != null` (or `RandomSfx` has entries).
- The track is as intended: `sound.MmSoundManagerTrack == MMSoundManager.MMSoundManagerTracks.Sfx` (or the chosen track).
- In Play mode, right after playing, `MMSoundManager.Instance.HasSoundsPlaying(<track>)` is true; for a looping sound it stays true.
- For UI mute buttons, the button's `onClick.GetPersistentMethodName(0)` is the expected method (for example `MuteMaster`).
- The Console has no errors.

## Common issues

- **Sound feedback plays nothing** → no clip assigned, the track is muted or at volume 0, or the clip is set on the wrong source mode (`Source = AudioResource` with only `Sfx` filled) → assign the clip for the selected `Source`, check track volumes in the MMSoundManager inspector.
- **Everything is silent after testing a mute button** → settings were saved while muted and `AutoLoad` restores them → unmute (`UnmuteMaster`), trigger `ResetSettings`, or delete saved data with `Tools > More Mountains > Delete all saved data` (ask first; it deletes all MMTools save files).
- **Two sound managers / duplicated sounds after loading a scene** → the manager is a persistent singleton and each scene has its own copy → keep a single manager in a bootstrap scene, or accept that duplicates destroy themselves.
- **Simple `Sound` feedback is silent** → `PlayMethod = Event` with no manager listening → add an `MMSoundManager`, or switch to `Cached`.
- **Sounds cut off when many play at once** → the audio source pool is too small (`AudioSourcePoolSize = 10` by default) → raise it on the manager; use `DoNotAutoRecycleIfNotDonePlaying` for sounds that must finish.
- **Same clip stacks too loudly** → set `DoNotPlayIfClipAlreadyPlaying`, or lower `MaximumConcurrentInstances` (3 by default) on the MMSoundManager Sound feedback.
- **A sound stops on scene change** → it isn't persistent → set `Persistent = true` on the feedback or in `MMSoundManagerPlayOptions` (for playlists, see `feel-sound-and-playlist-setup`).

## Boundaries

- MMSoundManager is optional and coexists with other audio systems (FMOD, Wwise or plain `AudioSource`s); it does not drive middleware.
- It uses Unity's `AudioMixer`; mixer effects, snapshots and routing are Unity features configured in the mixer asset.
- Audio filters on individual sources (`Audio > Audio Filter *` feedbacks) and AudioSource property feedbacks don't go through the manager; see `feel-add-feedbacks`.
- Haptics synced to audio (Nice Vibrations clips converted from audio) are covered by `feel-haptics`.
